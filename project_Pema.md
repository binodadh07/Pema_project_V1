# Project Baby Goods Exchange

## 1. General Project Information

**Project Name:**  
Baby Goods Exchange

### Project Statement
The cost of raising a baby is very high, and many parents struggle to afford essential items. At the same time, families often find themselves with gently used baby products that they no longer need and piled as clutter. This project aims to create an online marketplace where parents can buy, sell, and exchange second-hand or unused baby goods, in a safe, reliable, and affordable way.

This initiative promotes sustainability by reducing waste, supporting families financially, and building a community of parents helping each other.

## 2. Project Objectives

- Develop a user-friendly online platform for parents to list, exchange, donate, or sell baby products.
- Foster a community-driven marketplace with a focus on sustainability and affordability.
- Provide safety guidelines and quality assurance for exchanged goods.
- Implement secure payment and delivery options for convenience.
- Build partnerships with charities to distribute donated baby goods to families in need.
